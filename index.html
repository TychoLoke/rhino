          <p>
            RhinoDicks.com is the planet's premier satire outlet dedicated to the colossal confidence of rhinoceroses everywhere.
            We poke fun at bravado, overcompensation, and the myths of macho culture without ever getting graphic. Think of us as
            the late-night monologue for creatures who believe their horn can solve anything.
